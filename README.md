This project was developed using Java and C#, and I employed Clean Architecture (also known as N-Tier Architecture) for the implementation. I primarily focused on fulfilling the logic required by the assignment and chose to avoid adding unnecessary complexity. For data handling, I included the CSV file you provided and implemented data fetching from this file. In a real-world scenario, a database and associated migrations would typically be used.

I hope this demonstration meets your expectations, and I look forward to receiving your feedback.
